<h1>Guess the Number Client-side Application </h1>

This is the front-end user interface that couples with the Guess the Number REST API, to simulate the game Cows & Bulls.

Using a combination of JS, HTML and CSS, this application communicates with the REST API to present with user with a clean interface for inputting guesses, and receiving feedback. This work demonstrates the ideas of HTML structure, HTML manipulation with JS and various methods of styling with CSS.
