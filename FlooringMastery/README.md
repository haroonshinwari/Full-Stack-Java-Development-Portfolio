<h1>Flooring Mastery</h1>

Flooring Mastery is an order management system written in Java. The programme allows the user to create, delete, update and search for flooring-material shipment orders. 

This project brings together everything learnt in the first half of the course and illustrates the fundamental concepts of Java in a business context, such as 
- MVC architecture (including a service layer),
- Spring dependency injection, 
- Correct use of Lambdas and Streams
- Rigorous Unit testing, 
- Data persistence 
- Appropriate money-handling using BigDecimal
- Exception Handling 

Additional products and serviced tax-code areas can also be loaded in by adding them to the appropriate text files (e.g. Products.txt & Taxes.txt). 
All transactions are appropriately logged, to an external file (Audit.txt) for later inspection.
