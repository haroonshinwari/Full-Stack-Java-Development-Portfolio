<h1>Vending Machine</h1>

The Vending Machine application simulates a vending machine, allowing the user to insert coins, purchase items, display error messages and return the correct change if necessary.The inventory is stored locally in a text file. The application uses the MVC pattern and constructor based dependency injection. 

This was the the third project on the course and made use of the more advanced concepts in Java such as:

- Use of Big Decimal API for all monetary calculations
- Use of Lambdas and Steams in the DAO
- Use of a service layer to contain business logic
- Unit tests for the service layer and DAO
- Maintaining an audit log of every transaction, successful or failed
