# Investment Guild
The Investment Guild is an end-to-end Full Stack Java web-app. It was the final project I worked on with the Software Guild (as part of the mThree Aspire Scholarship Programme). The application simulates a trade management platform, with which users can create, edit and delete order from a list of real-world NASDAQ symbols / MPIDs. Users can submit trades, as well as view historic trades, using the systems search feature. The application contains a login and user creation portal for security, and to identify trades by a unique id.

The application consists of a Spring Boot back-end server, written in Java. The server links to an mySQL database, using JPA, that was used to store information regarding orders, historic trades, and user information. The front-end was built using react, and was styled with a combination of CSS and Material-UI assets. I collaborated with a team of three other graduate developers on this project; giving us all the opportunity to develop our teamwork skills. Through this work, I gained a strong understand of version control when collaborating with multiple developers.
