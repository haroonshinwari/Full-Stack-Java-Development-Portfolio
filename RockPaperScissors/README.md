<h1>Rock Paper Scissors</h1>

Rock Paper Scissors is a simple game in which you play the classic playground game against the computer using the command line. The application is packaged as a JAR file using Maven. 

This was the first project on the course and the application highlights some of the basic fundamentals of Java that were covered:
- Planning using a flowchart 
- Naming and using variables correctrly
- Loops and conditionals
- Using arrays correctly
- Creating the documentation for an application (implementation plan, backout plan, release notes)
