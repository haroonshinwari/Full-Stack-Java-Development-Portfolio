<h1>React Vending Machine</h1>

React Vending Machine is a dynamic user-interface that employs a REST API. This project demonstrates the fundamentals of designing a front-end web applications with React, such as effective component design, efficient parent-child tree structure, appropriate use of class state & properties, and retrieving & display user input errors from back-end server.

The application dynamically generates JSX, and renders it to the DOM, based on data supplied by the external Vending Machine API (maintained by The Software Guild). This ensure that it always displays up-to-date pricing and inventory information.
